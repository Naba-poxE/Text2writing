## 🤗 Hello First-time Contributors

There are lot of resources (articles, courses, videos) available for getting started with git and GitHub you can search and follow any of the resource you like.

- You can pick any of the issues from [Issues](https://github.com/Naba-poxE/Text2writing/issues) or If you feel like it needs extra feature or if you find bug, you can create your own issue.
- You can drop a comment on issue saying "Hi nabaexpo, let me work on this or I will kill you 🔪" to avoid multiple people working on the same PR.

Lastly, It is fine if you mess something up. If there is anything wrong in the PR I will let you know how to fix that in comments of the PR.

If you are still scared to drop a PR or need any help, you can always drop me a message on my [Instagram @nabaexpo](https://instagram.com/nabaexpo) or drop me an email at info@nabaexpo.com.
